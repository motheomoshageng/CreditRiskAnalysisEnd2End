# 📊 Credit Risk Analysis with Machine Learning
Predicting loan default risk using historical financial data and supervised learning algorithms.

## 🧠 Project Objective

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to assess credit risk by predicting whether a loan applicant is likely to default. It simulates a real-world financial risk evaluation workflow — from data preprocessing to model deployment.

## 📁 Dataset

- Public dataset (e.g., [Kaggle: Loan Prediction]https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atulmittal199174/credit-risk-analysis-for-extending-bank-loans/data)  
- Features include: `age`, `ed`, `employ`, `debtinc`, 'creddebt', 'othdebt' ,'default' 
- Target variable: `default` (defaulted or not)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Language**: Python  
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Modeling**: Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)  
- **Scaling**: StandardScaler  
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC  
- **Deployment**: in progress

## 🔍 Key Steps

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Identified correlations and missing values  
   - Visualized distributions and target imbalance

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding  
   - Standardized features using `StandardScaler`

3. **Model Development**  
   - Trained and tuned multiple classifiers  
   - Selected the best-performing model using cross-validation

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Compared models using classification metrics


# 📈 Results

- Achieved ** 85.2% accuracy**  on test data  
- Final model: **Random Forest**  
- Handles **imbalanced classes** and scales well to unseen data
